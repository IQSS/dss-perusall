Perusal is a browser-based software platform for interactive learning. Why are we using Perusall? Some of our Data Science Workshops are being taught using a “flipped classroom” model — this is where lecture-based material is delivered asyncronously so that it can be digested at your own pace, which provides more time for Q&amp;A discussion during in-class time. Prior to our Zoom-based 1 hour Q&amp;A session, there will be a two week self-study period within which you can work through the workshop materials at your own pace. We are using Persuall as a means to facilitate greater engagement with the workshop materials during this self-study period. Using Perusall, you will be able to post questions and comments about parts of the materials you do not understand or problems you encounter. Instructors can answer your questions and comments, but you will also have the opportunity to reply to questions and comments from other participants. In this way, Perusall facilitates peer-to-peer and peer-to-instructor learning. Your successful completion of the workshop will be based on making a contribution, via questions and comments, during this self-study period. "],

No new material will be presented during this session – rather, this will be an additional opportunity to ask questions and get feedback about the materials. The instructor will use the questions submitted on Perusall as a starting point for discussion and possibly for short code demonstrations illustrating conceptual or syntactical stumbling blocks. All participants will initially be entered into a Zoom waiting room and the presenter will admit them to the session. Any participants arriving in the wait room more than 5 mins past the listed start time of the session will not be admitted. "]
